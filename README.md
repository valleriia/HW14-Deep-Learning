### **Which model has a lower loss?**
LSTM Stock Predictor Using Closing Prices model has a lower loss as it is more accurate in comparison to the FNG model.
### **Which model tracks the actual values better over time?**
Closing model price prediction is much more aligned with the actual closing BTC prices than the FNG model. This is not surprising, as graphing just the closing prices versus the FNG values shows a very low correlation.
### **Which window size works best for the model?**
A 3-day window appears to be the ideal window size. A window on the higher range (near 10) is too large to be predictive while a very small window (< 3) losses important information.
